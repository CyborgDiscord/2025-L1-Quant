### NOTE

---

- We want to prove the **alternative hypothesis** (what we believe is true).
- To do that, we first assume the **null hypothesis** (opposite of what we believe) is true.
- Then, we gather data to check if the null hypothesis looks wrong.
- If we can prove the null hypothesis is wrong, we can say the alternative hypothesis is likely true.
- If we can’t prove the null wrong, we don’t accept it as true; we just say there’s not enough evidence to prove it false.
