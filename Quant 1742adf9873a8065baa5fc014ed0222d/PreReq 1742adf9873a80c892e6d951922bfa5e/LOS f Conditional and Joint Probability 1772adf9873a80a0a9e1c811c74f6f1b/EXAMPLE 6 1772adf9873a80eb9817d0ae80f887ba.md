### ***BankCorp’s Earnings per Share (1)***

---

As part of your work as a banking industry analyst, you build models for forecasting earnings per share of the banks you cover. Today you are studying BankCorp. The historical record shows that in 55% of recent quarters, BankCorp’s EPS has increased sequentially, and in 45% of quarters, EPS has decreased or remained unchanged sequentially. At this point in your analysis, you are assuming that changes in sequential EPS are independent.

Earnings per share for 2Q:Year 1 (that is, EPS for the second quarter of Year 1) were larger than EPS for 1Q:Year 1.

1. **What is the probability that *3Q:Year 1 EPS will be larger than 2Q:Year 1 EPS* (a positive change in sequential EPS)?**
    - Show Solution
        
        <aside>
        
        Under the assumption of independence, the probability that *3Q:Year 1 EPS will be larger than 2Q:Year 1 EPS* is the unconditional probability of positive change, 0.55. The fact that 2Q:Year 1 EPS was larger than 1Q:Year 1 EPS is not useful information, because the next change in EPS is independent of the prior change.

2. **What is the probability that EPS decreases or remains unchanged in the next two quarters?**
    - Show Solution

        Assuming independence, the probability is 0.2025 = 0.45(0.45).

### **Explanation of EXAMPLE 6**

---

This question sets up a probability scenario in which you are analyzing the likelihood of earnings per share (EPS) changes for BankCorp based on historical data. Here's a breakdown of the key elements:

---

### **Context:**

1. **Purpose**: You are building models to forecast future earnings per share (EPS) for a bank (BankCorp).
2. **Historical Data**:
    - **55% probability ($P(\text{Increase}) = 0.55$)** that EPS increases sequentially (from one quarter to the next).
    - **45% probability ($P(\text{Decrease or No Change}) = 0.45$)** that EPS decreases or remains unchanged sequentially.
3. **Assumption**: Changes in sequential EPS are **independent**. This means that the change in EPS for one quarter does not affect the change in EPS for the next quarter.

---

### **What Does the Question Say?**

- **Known Information**: The EPS for **2Q:Year 1** (second quarter of Year 1) is greater than the EPS for **1Q:Year 1** (first quarter of Year 1).
    - This means an increase has already occurred between these two quarters.
- You might need to analyze or compute probabilities for future quarters, possibly using this historical pattern of increases and decreases.

---

### **Key Questions You May Be Asked:**

1. **What is the probability of an increase in EPS for future quarters?**
    - Since changes are independent, the historical probability of an increase remains 0.55, regardless of what happened in previous quarters.
        
        0.550.55
        
2. **What is the probability of a specific sequence of increases or decreases?**
    - For example, if you want to calculate the probability that EPS will increase in the next two quarters, you would use:
        
        $P(\text{Increase, Increase}) = P(\text{Increase}) \times P(\text{Increase}) = 0.55 \times 0.55 = 0.3025$
        
3. **How do sequential changes affect forecasts?**
    - If you assume independence, then the probabilities remain consistent over time, and historical patterns can be directly applied to forecast future changes.

---

### **Why Mention Independence?**

The assumption of independence simplifies calculations, as it means past EPS changes have no bearing on future probabilities. If changes were dependent, you would need additional data to determine how one quarter’s change affects the next.

Response 1

"Sequential" refers to events or data points occurring in a specific order over time. For example, sequential earnings per share (EPS) compares EPS values from consecutive time periods, such as one quarter to the next. This concept is used to analyze patterns, trends, or probabilities based on historical data.

"Sequential" refers to events or data points occurring in a specific order over time, such as comparing values from one period to the next to analyze patterns or trends.
