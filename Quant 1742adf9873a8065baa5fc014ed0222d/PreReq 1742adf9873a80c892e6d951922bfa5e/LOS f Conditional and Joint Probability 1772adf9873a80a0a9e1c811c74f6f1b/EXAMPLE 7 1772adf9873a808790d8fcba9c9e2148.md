### ***Screening Stocks for Investment***

---

You have developed a stock screen—a set of criteria for selecting stocks. Your investment universe (the set of securities from which you make your choices) is 905 large- and medium-cap US equities, specifically all stocks that are members of the S&P 500 and S&P 400 Indexes. Your criteria capture different aspects of the stock selection problem; you believe that the criteria are independent of each other, to a close approximation.

| **Criterion** | **Number of stocksmeeting criterion** | **Fraction of stocksmeeting criterion** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First valuation criterion | 556 | 0.614 |
| Second valuation criterion | 489 | 0.540 |
| Analyst coverage criterion | 600 | 0.663 |
| Profitability criterion | 490 | 0.541 |
| Financial strength criterion | 313 | 0.346 |

How many stocks do you expect to pass your screen?

    Only 37 stocks out of 905 should pass through your screen. If you define five events—*the stock passes the first valuation criterion, the stock passes the second valuation criterion, the stock passes the analyst coverage criterion, the company passes the profitability criterion, the company passes the financial strength criterion* (say events *A, B, C, D,* and *E,* respectively)—then the probability that a stock will pass all five criteria, under independence, is
    
    $*P(ABCDE) = P(A)P(B)P(C)P(D)P(E) = (0.614)(0.540)(0.663)(0.541)(0.346) = 0.0411*$
    
    Although only one of the five criteria is even moderately strict (the strictest lets 34.6% of stocks through), the probability that a stock can pass all five criteria is only 0.0411, or about 4%. If the criteria are independent, the size of the list of candidate investments is expected to be 0.0411(905) = 37 stocks.
