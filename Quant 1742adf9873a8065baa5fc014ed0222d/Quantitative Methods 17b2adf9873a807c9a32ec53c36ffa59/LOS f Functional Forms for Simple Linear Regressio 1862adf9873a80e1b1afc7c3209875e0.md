Yes, that's a good way to think about it! Intuitively, here's what's happening:
1. Alpha represents the threshold for how much risk you're willing to accept of falsely concluding there's something significant when there isn't (Type I error). For example, if alpha = 0.05, you're saying, "I'm okay with a 5% chance of being wrong."

2. When the p-value is smaller than alpha, it means the probability of the observed data happening if the null hypothesis were true is even lower than the threshold you set.

3. In simpler terms, you're saying:
"If nothing significant is going on (null is true), the chance of seeing data this extreme is very small, even smaller than the risk I was willing to take."
This gives you strong enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that something significant is likely happening.

Does this align with what you're trying to grasp?
