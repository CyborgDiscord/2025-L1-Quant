### What is Interquartile Range (IQR)?

---

**Interquartile Range (IQR)** is a measure of statistical dispersion that shows the range within which the **middle 50% of the data** lies. It is calculated as:

$IQR=Q3−Q1$

Where:

- **Q1 (1st Quartile)**: The value below which 25% of the data lies.
- **Q3 (3rd Quartile)**: The value below which 75% of the data lies.

### Purpose of IQR

1. **Identify Spread**: Helps to understand how spread out the central 50% of the data is.
2. **Robust to Outliers**: Unlike the range, it is not affected by extreme values or outliers.
3. **Detect Outliers**: Any value falling below $Q_1−1.5×\text{IQR}$ or above $Q_3+1.5×\text{IQR}$ is considered an outlier.
4. **Compare Data Sets**: Useful for comparing the variability of two or more distributions.

### Visualization

In a box plot:

- The box represents the IQR, spanning from Q1 to Q3.
- The whiskers extend to the smallest and largest non-outlier values.

IQR is particularly valuable in summarizing and interpreting **non-symmetrical data** and is widely used in exploratory data analysis.
