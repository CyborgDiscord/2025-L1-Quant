### Alpha

---

In the context of a **confidence interval**, **α = 5%** refers to the **significance level** or the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true (also known as the Type I error rate).

More specifically:

### Meaning of α = 5%:

- **α (alpha)** is the threshold for deciding whether the results of a statistical test are statistically significant.
- **α = 5%** means there is a **5% chance** (or 0.05 probability) of making a **Type I error** — which is incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true.

### In the context of Confidence Intervals:

- If you're constructing a **confidence interval** with **α = 5%**, it means you are aiming for a **95% confidence level**.
- This indicates that the interval you calculate will contain the true population parameter 95% of the time in repeated sampling. The remaining 5% represents the probability that the true population parameter falls outside the interval, which is the **alpha level**.

### Example:

- A **95% confidence interval** (when α = 5%) means that, if you were to repeat the sampling process many times, **95% of the intervals** constructed from those samples would contain the true population parameter, and **5% of the intervals** would not.

### Summary:

- **α = 5%** in the context of a confidence interval means you are using a **95% confidence level**, which gives a **5% probability** that the true population parameter is not contained within the interval.

### Hypothesis

---

### What is a Hypothesis?

A **hypothesis** is a statement or assumption that can be tested through statistical methods. It is essentially an educated guess about a population parameter or the relationship between variables. In statistics, hypotheses are used to make predictions and draw conclusions based on sample data.

There are two main types of hypotheses in hypothesis testing:

1. **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**:
    
    The **null hypothesis** typically states that there is no effect, no difference, or no relationship between variables. It assumes that any observed effect or difference in the data is due to random chance.
    
    Example:
    
    - "There is no difference in average height between men and women in a population."
    - "The new drug has no effect on reducing blood pressure compared to the placebo."
2. **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁ or Ha)**:
    
    The **alternative hypothesis** proposes that there is a significant effect, difference, or relationship between variables. It contradicts the null hypothesis.
    
    Example:
    
    - "Men and women have different average heights in the population."
    - "The new drug reduces blood pressure compared to the placebo."

### What Does "Rejecting the Null Hypothesis" Mean?

**Rejecting the null hypothesis** means that the statistical evidence from the sample data is strong enough to conclude that the null hypothesis is unlikely to be true. In other words, there is sufficient evidence to support the alternative hypothesis.

### Key Points about Rejecting the Null Hypothesis:

1. **Statistical Significance**:
    - You reject the null hypothesis when the results from your sample data show that the observed effect is statistically significant — meaning it is unlikely to have occurred by chance.
    - This is usually determined by calculating a **p-value**, which is compared to a pre-defined significance level (**α**). If the **p-value** is smaller than **α** (for example, 0.05 or 5%), you reject the null hypothesis.
2. **Evidence for the Alternative Hypothesis**:
    - When you reject the null hypothesis, you are suggesting that the alternative hypothesis is more likely to be true.
    - For example, rejecting the null hypothesis that a new drug has no effect implies that the drug likely does have an effect.

### Example of Hypothesis Testing:

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: There is no difference in average test scores between two teaching methods.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: There is a difference in average test scores between the two teaching methods.

After conducting the experiment and analyzing the data, you calculate a **p-value**. If the **p-value** is less than 0.05 (i.e., α = 5%), you **reject the null hypothesis** and conclude that there is a statistically significant difference between the two teaching methods.

### What Happens if You Fail to Reject the Null Hypothesis?

- If the evidence from the sample data is not strong enough to reject the null hypothesis (i.e., the p-value is greater than the significance level), you **fail to reject** the null hypothesis.
- This does not prove that the null hypothesis is true, but rather suggests that there is insufficient evidence to support the alternative hypothesis.

### Summary:

- A **hypothesis** is a testable statement about a population.
- The **null hypothesis** assumes no effect or no difference, while the **alternative hypothesis** suggests that an effect or difference exists.
- **Rejecting the null hypothesis** means there is enough statistical evidence to support the alternative hypothesis.

### Type I error

---

The type I error level of significance, also known as the alpha level, is **the probability of incorrectly rejecting a true null hypothesis**.

---

Let's break down the sentence **"the probability of incorrectly rejecting a true null hypothesis"** step by step:

### 1. **The null hypothesis (H₀)**:

- The **null hypothesis** is a statement that assumes **no effect** or **no difference** exists in the population. For example, it might say, "There is no difference in the average heights of men and women."

### 2. **Rejecting a null hypothesis**:

- **Rejecting** the null hypothesis means that the evidence from your data suggests the null hypothesis is **unlikely** to be true. In simpler terms, you're concluding that there is an effect or difference.
- For example, if you reject the null hypothesis, you're saying, "Based on my data, there is a significant difference in the average heights of men and women."

### 3. **True null hypothesis**:

- A **true null hypothesis** means that in reality, there **is no effect** or **no difference**. In our example, it would mean that in the entire population, there is no difference in the average heights of men and women.

### 4. **Incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis**:

- **Incorrectly rejecting** the null hypothesis means you mistakenly conclude that there is a significant effect or difference when, in reality, there is none.
- This is called a **Type I error** (also known as a "false positive"), and it happens when you reject a true null hypothesis.

### 5. **Probability**:

- The **probability** refers to the **likelihood** or **chance** of something happening. In this case, it's the likelihood of making a mistake — rejecting a true null hypothesis when it should not be rejected.

### Putting it all together:

- **"The probability of incorrectly rejecting a true null hypothesis"** means:
    - "The chance that you will mistakenly reject the null hypothesis when, in fact, there is no effect or difference (i.e., the null hypothesis is actually true)."
    - This mistake is called a **Type I error**.

### Example:

- Imagine you're testing if a new drug improves health. Your **null hypothesis** is "the drug has no effect."
- After testing, you **reject the null hypothesis**, concluding the drug does have an effect.
- However, if the drug really has **no effect**, but you mistakenly concluded it does, you made an **incorrect rejection** of a true null hypothesis.
- The **probability** of making this mistake is typically set at **5%** (α = 0.05), meaning there's a 5% chance of rejecting the true null hypothesis when you shouldn't.

### Summary:

- **"The probability of incorrectly rejecting a true null hypothesis"** is the chance of making a mistake by concluding that something is true (e.g., the drug works) when it actually isn't true (the drug has no effect).
