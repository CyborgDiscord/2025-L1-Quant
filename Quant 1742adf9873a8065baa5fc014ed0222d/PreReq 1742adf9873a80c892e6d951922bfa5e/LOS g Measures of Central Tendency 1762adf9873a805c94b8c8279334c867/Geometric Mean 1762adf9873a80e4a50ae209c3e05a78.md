### **Geometric Mean as Compounded Returns**

---

- The geometric mean reflects the compounded growth rate over multiple periods. *(The geometric mean shows the average compounded return over multiple periods, accounting for the effect of compounding.)*
- It accounts for how returns build on each other (multiplicative effect), unlike the arithmetic mean, which is a simple average.
- It helps smooth out fluctuations in returns and indicates the actual annualized growth rate of an investment.

---

**Example**:

An investment earns **+3% in Year 1**, **+4% in Year 2**, and **+5% in Year 3**.

- **Arithmetic Mean**: (3% + 4% + 5%) / 3 = **4%** (simple average).
- **Geometric Mean**:
    
    $\sqrt[3]{(1.03 \times 1.04 \times 1.05)} - 1 \approx 3.97\%$
    

---

**How GM Helps**:

- It considers the compounding effect of returns over time.
- Unlike the arithmetic mean, it reflects the actual annualized growth rate of the investment.

---

**What It Indicates**:

- The geometric mean (**3.97%**) indicates the consistent annual growth rate that would result in the same total return over three years.

Using the data in [Exhibit 33](Geometric%20Mean%201762adf9873a80e4a50ae209c3e05a78.md), calculate the arithmetic mean and the geometric mean returns over the three years for each of the three stock indexes: those of Country D, Country E, and Country F.

    The arithmetic mean returns calculations are:
    
    |  | **Annual Return (%)** |  |  | **Sum $∑^3_{i=1} 𝑅_i$** | **Arithmetic Mean** |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    |  | **Year 1** | **Year 2** | **Year 3** |  |  |
    | Country D | −2.4 | −3.1 | 6.2 | 0.7 | 0.233 |
    | Country E | −4.0 | −3.0 | 3.0 | −4.0 | −1.333 |
    | Country F | 5.4 | 5.2 | −1.0 | 9.6 | 3.200 |

    Geometric mean returns calculations are:
    
    |  | **1 + Return in Decimal Form (1+$*R_t*$)** |  |  | **Product $∏^𝑇_𝑡(1+𝑅_𝑡)$** | **3rd root $[∏^3_𝑡(1+𝑅_𝑡)]^{\frac{1}{3}}$** | **Geometric mean return (%)** |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    |  | **Year 1** | **Year 2** | **Year 3** |  |  |  |
    | Country D | 0.976 | 0.969 | 1.062 | 1.00438 | 1.00146 | 0.146 |
    | Country E | 0.960 | 0.970 | 1.030 | 0.95914 | 0.98619 | −1.381 |
    | Country F | 1.054 | 1.052 | 0.990 | 1.09772 | 1.03157 | 3.157 |
