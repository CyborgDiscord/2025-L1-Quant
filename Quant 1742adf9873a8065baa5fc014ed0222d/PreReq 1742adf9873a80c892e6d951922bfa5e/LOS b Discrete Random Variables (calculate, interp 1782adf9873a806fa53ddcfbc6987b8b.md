### What is a Function?

---

A **function** is a rule that assigns **exactly one output** to each input. Think of it as a machine:

1. You feed it an input (let's call it $x$).
2. The machine applies a rule (like squaring the input).
3. It gives you an output (let's call it $y$).

Mathematically, we write:

$$
y = f(x)
$$

Here:

- $f(x)$ is the function (the rule).
- $x$ is the input.
- $y$ is the output.

### Why Does $y = x^2$ Look Like That?

1. **The Rule**:
    
    For $y = x^2$, the function says, “Take the input $x$, and square it.”
    
    Example:
    
    - If $x=2$, then $y=2^2=4$.
    - If $x=−3$, then $y=(−3)^2=9$.
2. **Graphing It**:
    - The graph shows all possible $x$ values on the horizontal axis and their corresponding $y$ values on the vertical axis.
    - For $y = x^2$, as $x$ gets larger (positive or negative), $y$ grows quickly because squaring amplifies the size of $x$.
3. **Why It Looks Like a U (Parabola)**:
    - Squaring any $x$ always gives a **non-negative $y$** (e.g., $x^2$ is never negative).
    - The graph is **symmetric** because squaring $x$ or $−x$ gives the same result (e.g., $3^2 = 9$ and $(-3)^2 = 9$).
    - Near $x=0$, the squared values are small (e.g., $0.5^2 = 0.25$), making the graph flat.
    - As $∣x∣$ increases, the squared values grow rapidly (e.g., $10^2 = 100$), making the graph curve steeply upwards.
4. **Key Features**:
    - **Vertex**: The lowest point of the graph is at $(0,0)$.
    - **Symmetry**: The graph is symmetric about the $y$-axis.
    - **Domain**: All real numbers ($-\infty < x < \infty$).
    - **Range**: Non-negative numbers ($y \geq 0$).

### Summary:

A function like $y = x^2$ translates inputs ($x$) into outputs ($y$) by following a rule. The shape of the graph reflects the behavior of this rule. For $y = x^2$, the parabola shows how squaring works, being symmetric and always non-negative.

### NOTE

---

### Why is $y = x^2$ a Parabola?

1. **Squaring Effect**:
    - Squaring $x$ (both positive and negative) always gives a positive $y$. This symmetry creates a "U" shape.
2. **Rate of Change**:
    - As $∣x∣$ increases, $x^2$ grows faster (non-linear increase). This steepens the curve as you move away from $x=0$.
3. **Vertex and Symmetry**:
    - The vertex at $(0,0)$ represents the lowest point since squaring any number produces values greater than or equal to zero.
    - The function is symmetric because $(-x)^2 = x^2$.
