### **Target downside deviation answers the question:**

---

> *"How much do the returns that fall below a specific target (e.g., a minimum acceptable return) differ from that target on average, focusing only on the negative returns?"*
> 
- It measures the average shortfall or downside risk relative to a target return, ignoring any positive deviations.

        | **Sum** |  |  |  | **84** |
        
        **Target semideviation** = $\sqrt{\frac{84}{11}} = 2.7634\%$

2. **If the target return were 4%, would your answer be different from that for question 1? Without using calculations, explain how would it be different?**
    - Show Solution
        
        <aside>
        
        If the target return is higher, then the existing deviations would be larger and there would be several more values in the deviations and squared deviations below the target; so, the target semideviation would be larger.

3. **Compare the standard deviation, the target downside deviation if the target is 2%, and the target downside deviation if the target is 3%.**
    - Show Solution
        
        <aside>
        
        The standard deviation is based on the deviation from the mean, which is 2.25%. The standard deviation includes all deviations from the mean, not just those below it. This results in a sample standard deviation of 2.958%.
        
        Considering just the four observations below the 2% target, the target semideviation is 2.195%. It is less than the sample standard deviation since target semideviation captures only the downside risk (i.e., deviations below the target). Considering target semideviation with a 3% target, there are now five observations below 3%, so the target semideviation is higher, at 2.763%.
