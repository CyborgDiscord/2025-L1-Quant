### **Using a Confidence Interval in Hypothesis Testing**

---

Consider the hypotheses $*H_0: µ = 3*$ versus $*H_a: µ ≠ 3*$. If the confidence interval based on sample information has a lower bound of 2.75 and an upper bound of 4.25, the *most* appropriate decision is:

**A. ****reject the null hypothesis.

**B.** accept the null hypothesis.

**C.** fail to reject the null hypothesis.

    C is correct. Since the hypothesized population mean (µ = 3) is within the bounds of the confidence interval (2.75, 4.25), the correct decision is to fail to reject the null hypothesis. It is only when the hypothesized value is outside these bounds that the null hypothesis is rejected. Note that the null hypothesis is never accepted; either the null is rejected on the basis of the evidence or there is a failure to reject the null hypothesis.

### **Decisions and Significance**

---

An analyst is testing whether there are positive risk-adjusted returns to a trading strategy. He collects a sample and tests the hypotheses of $*H_0: µ ≤ 0\%*$ versus $*H_a: µ > 0\%*$, where $µ$ is the population mean risk-adjusted return. The mean risk-adjusted return for the sample is 0.7%. The calculated *t*-statistic is 2.428, and the critical *t*-value is 2.345. He estimates that the transaction costs are 0.3%. The results are *most likely*:

**A. ****statistically and economically significant.

**B.** statistically significant but not economically significant.

**C.** economically significant but not statistically significant.

- Show Solution
    
    <aside>
    
    A is correct. The results indicate that the mean risk-adjusted return is greater than 0% because the calculated test statistic of 2.428 is greater than the critical value of 2.245. The results are also economically significant because the risk-adjusted return exceeds the transaction cost associated with this strategy by 0.4% (= 0.7 − 0.3).
