    > EXAMPLE 9
    > 
    > - In TWRR, we usually raise to 1/n to annualize the return, but in this question, we didn't because the returns are already given for each quarter. Since we’re just linking those quarterly returns to get the total performance, we didn’t need to annualize it.

    >     
    >     If we had 8 quarters, we’d combine the returns just like this. To annualize, we’d raise the result to 1/2 because 8 quarters is 2 years. We didn’t do that in EX9 since it was already for one period.

    > - CF1
    >     - Capital gain of USD10 million is already reflected in market value on 31 December.
    >     - +USD2 million (dividend) -USD2 million (reinvested) -USD20 million (additional investment) = -USD20 million.
