### Z-Value

---

A **z-value** (or z-score) represents the number of **standard deviations** a data point is from the **mean** of the distribution. It tells you how far, in terms of standard deviations, a value is from the mean.

- **Formula**:
    
    $$
    z = \frac{(X - \mu)}{\sigma}
    $$
    
    Where:
    
    - $X$ = Data point
    - $\mu$ = Mean of the distribution
    - $\sigma$ = Standard deviation
- **Interpretation**:
    - A **positive z-value** means the data point is above the mean.
    - A **negative z-value** means the data point is below the mean.
    - A **z-value of 0** means the data point is exactly at the mean.

---

In normal distribution, the **z-value** helps in finding probabilities (areas under the curve) and comparing different data points relative to the mean.
