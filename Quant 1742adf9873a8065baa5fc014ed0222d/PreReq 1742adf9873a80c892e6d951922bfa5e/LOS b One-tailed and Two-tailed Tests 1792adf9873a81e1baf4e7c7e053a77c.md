### **Specifying the Hypotheses**

---

An analyst suspects that in the most recent year excess returns on stocks have fallen below 5%. She wants to study whether the excess returns are less than 5%. Designating the population mean as $μ$, which hypotheses are most appropriate for her analysis?

**A. ***$H_0: µ = 5$* versus $*H_a: µ ≠ 5*$

**B.** $*H_0: µ \ge 5*$ versus $*H_a: µ < 5*$

**C.** $*H_0: µ \le 5*$ versus $*H_a: µ > 5*$

    B is correct. The null hypothesis is what she wants to reject in favor of the alternative, which is that population mean excess return is less than 5%. This is a one-sided (left-side) alternative hypothesis.
