### NOTE

---

1. **AND (∩)**: The "AND" operation refers to the intersection of two events. It represents the probability that both events happen simultaneously. This is often written as:
    
    $P(A \, \text{AND} \, B) = P(A \cap B)$
    
    For example, if you want the probability of drawing a red card **and** a queen from a deck of cards, both conditions need to be true.

2. **OR (∪)**: The "OR" operation refers to the union of two events. It represents the probability that at least one of the events happens. This is written as:
    
    $P(A \, \text{OR} \, B) = P(A \cup B)$
    
    For example, if you want the probability of drawing a red card **or** a queen, only one of the conditions needs to be true.

    The formula for the OR operation, when events are not mutually exclusive (i.e., they can happen at the same time), is:
    
    $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$
    
    You subtract $P(A \cap B)$ to avoid double-counting the probability when both events happen at the same time.
